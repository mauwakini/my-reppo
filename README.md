## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the King County housing data set and to build predictive multiple linear regression models that can be useful in identifying factors that affect the sale prices of houses in King County and provide data-driven insights to homeowners on how home renovations can increase property values. 

## Business Problem
- What house features have the greatest correlation on price?
- How much do each of these features influence house price?
- What house features have the greatest effect on price?
- How much do each of these features influence house price?
- Are there typical house features that are presumed to inherently influence house prices but do not do so in this particular scenario?

## Goal and Users
Our main objective is to aid prospective investors, real estate agents and homeowners in making informed choices by furnishing them with data and insights obtained through an extensive examination of the King County real estate market. By exploring how various features correlate with changes in home values.

## Dataset
This project uses the King County House Sales dataset which can be found in the file "kc_house_data.csv", in this repo. The description of the column names can be found in the 'column_names.md' file in this repository.
